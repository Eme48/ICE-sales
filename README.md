# 🎮 Video Game Sales Analysis – ICE

## 🧠 Context
This project was developed as part of my Data Science Bootcamp at TripleTen.  
The goal was to analyze historical sales and ratings data for video games, and identify the most relevant factors contributing to their success.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To determine which attributes (genre, platform, rating, user reviews, etc.) are most strongly associated with high game sales.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Game titles, genres, release years
- Platforms and publishers
- User and critic scores
- Global, regional and total sales figures

> *(Dataset was provided by ICE for academic purposes – not publicly redistributed.)*

---

## 🔍 Key Analyses
- Correlation matrix of variables
- Comparison of average sales by genre and platform
- Distribution of review scores vs sales
- Identification of top-performing games by sales segment

---

## 🧠 Insights
- Certain genres (e.g. Shooter, Sports) consistently outperform others in global sales.
- Platform and publisher influence varies significantly by region.
- Higher critic scores moderately correlate with sales, but not always linearly.

---

## 📌 Next Steps
- Build a simple predictive model for sales based on game attributes.
- Add interactive visuals using Plotly or Streamlit (in future version).
